# Volley Pong

_A multi-player racquet sport that is a mix between Volley Ball and Table Tennis (sort of...)._

## Description

A designated player from the serving team will commence in _service_.  The player serves the ball to the opposing side in the same way that a "Doubles Table Tennis" match would be served. 

Each player on the returning side "sets" the ball (ie. hits the ball up for the next teammate).  The ball is set between each teammate at least once before an offensive play is attempted.

The returning team either commits an error and yields the point to the opposition; or, an offensive attempt is made by returning the ball to the original side of the table for the other team to handle.  The process continues until one of the teams score.

## Starting the game

A random player sets the ball up for the next player to their left; moving in a clockwise direction.  Each succeeding player will also set the ball up.  The first player to make an error yields the first _service_ to the opposing team.


## Number of players

* The number of players _MUST_ be symmetrical.  In other words, there must not be a different number of players on one team compared to the other.

* Three (3) to five (5) players is ideal for continuous gameplay (although any number of players is permitted as previously mentioned).


## Positions

Players usually form a semi-circle around their side of the table.  This is, however, not required since some players might choose to stand further back for defensive purposes.

In a typical game consisting of 3 - 5 players per team, there is on player in the middle (on deck to be the server).  The other players are in the surrounding areas of the table.

When a service is complete, the players rotate in a clockwise fashion.

## Service

Each team will serve the ball Five (5) times before alternating to the opposing team.

The service is similar to a serve in "Doubles Table Tennis," where the following criteria are met:

1. The ball is tossed straight up by the server at least 6 inches.
2. It is struck, and bounces on the server's side of the table first, over the net, the bounces on the opposing team's side of the table.

_The side of which the serve hits on the table is not relevant._

## Scoring

## Defense

## Offense

## Equipment
 
The game is typically played with table tennis racquets and a table tennis ball.  Although there _could_ be alternatives, each player should use the same type of racquet.

## Surroundings

There are surrounding surfaces that are considered "fair game" and will keep the ball in play.
* The table.
* Vertical surfaces that are NOT human (eg. walls).
* Pipes (the cylindrical shape presents too much grey area).
