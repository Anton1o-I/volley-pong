# Volley Pong

_A multi-player racquet sport that is a mix between Volley Ball and Table Tennis (sort of...)._

## Description

A designated player from the serving team will commence in _service_.  The player serves the ball to the opposing side in the same way that a "Doubles Table Tennis" match would be served. 

Each player on the returning side "sets" the ball (ie. hits the ball up for the next teammate).  The ball is set between each teammate at least once before an offensive play is attempted.

The returning team either commits an error and yields the point to the opposition; or, an offensive attempt is made by returning the ball to the original side of the table for the other team to handle.  The process continues until one of the teams score.

## Starting the game


## Number of players

* The number of players _MUST_ be symmetrical.  In other words, there must not be a different number of players on one team compared to the other.

* Three (3) to five (5) players is ideal for continuous gameplay (although any number of players is permitted as previously mentioned).
